## Crash Prevention App 
### Our project is to create an IOS App to help decrease car accidents from happening.

There are many ways to prevent car accidents from happening, one of our ideas is to warn the driver and somehow tell him that there is a probability of a crash ahead. 
We are using ARKit and UIKit to developed the application (in swift) using XCODE. 
The problem we are having is to get a colored image and to display the distance on the phone; on the other hand, we were able to display a black and white live image (depth map) on the iPhone and display the distance based on the color (the darker, the closer is the object)

Our next goals are to hopefully find a way to represent the image in color and get the distance displayed on the screen.
After these goals are accomplished successfully we are to detect the object and analyzing it to tell what the object is, and, if necessary, warn the driver to slow down or to stop depending on the vehicle speed.
